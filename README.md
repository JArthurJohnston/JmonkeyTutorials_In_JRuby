# JmonkeyTutorials_In_JRuby

I wanted to try game development in ruby, using Java's Jmonkey engine. 

JMonkey is essentially an abstraction of OpenGL. And with the power of JRuby, we're able to code quality, 3D games in our beloved ruby programming language.

## Installation

Note: these tutorials will only with with jRuby. And they've only been tested on version 1.7.23. If you have not already done so, go to http://jruby.org/ and follow their instructions to download and install jRuby on your machine

1. Clone or download this repo and copy the files to a folder of your choice.
2. In that folder create a directory and name it 'lib'.
3. download the latest JME zip file from http://updates.jmonkeyengine.org/stable/3.0/engine/
4. Extract the jMonkeyEngine3.jar file from the zip and put it in the 'lib' folder you created.
5. Enjoy using jMonkey in ruby!

## Usage

Open up your preffered terminal or command promt and navigate to the 'Source' directory where you extracted this repo. Each file is a stand-alone script. So all you have to do is run any of the 'hello' scripts. You can do this by executing
jruby <script_name>.rb 
in your command prompt.

Once youve run a script you will see the basic jMonkey splash screen. Choose the settings you want and continue to run the program.
