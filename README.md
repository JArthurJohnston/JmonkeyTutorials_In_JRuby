# JmonkeyTutorials_In_JRuby

I wanted to try game development in ruby, using Java's Jmonkey engine. 

JMonkey is essentially an abstraction of OpenGL. And with the power of JRuby, we're able to code quality, 3D games in our beloved ruby programming language.

## Installation

1. Clone or download all the files in the 'Source' directory. 
2. Create a folder in the 'Source' directory and name it 'lib'
3. download the latest JME zip file from http://updates.jmonkeyengine.org/stable/3.0/engine/
4. Extract the jMonkeyEngine3.jar file from the zip and put it in the 'lib' folder you created.
5. Enjoy using jMonkey in ruby!
